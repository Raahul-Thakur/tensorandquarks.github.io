        <p><h1 id="from-circuits-to-cognition-following-the-thoughts-of-claude-35">From Circuits to Cognition: Following the Thoughts of Claude 3.5</h1>
<h2 id="decoding-anthropics-next-step-in-understanding-language-models">Decoding Anthropic’s Next Step in Understanding Language Models</h2>

<p>In my previous post, we explored <em>“On the Biology of a Large Language Model”</em>, Anthropic’s groundbreaking research that mapped the internal circuits of Claude 3.5 Haiku using <strong>attribution graphs</strong>. These graphs offered a glimpse into the hidden architecture of reasoning — showing how Claude decomposes questions, plans poems, reasons across languages, and even hallucinates.</p>

<p>But what if we could go a step further?</p>

<p>What if, instead of just identifying the components responsible for thought, we could <strong>trace a single idea as it unfolds inside the model — moment by moment, token by token</strong>?</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Anthropic attempts in their new article: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model"><em>“Tracing the Thoughts of a Language Model”</em></a>. It builds directly on the foundation of attribution graphs and pushes us deeper into the mind of a transformer — not to observe its structure, but to follow its <em>thinking</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="thought-as-a-path-not-just-a-spark">Thought as a Path, Not Just a Spark</h2>

<p>The original paper dissected how circuits activate to solve sub-tasks — arithmetic, rhyme planning, multilingual parsing. In this new work, Anthropic tracks what happens <strong>after</strong> a feature activates. Where does it go? What does it influence? What follows?</p>

<p>Imagine prompting Claude with a sentence like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Describe how biology influences philosophy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This prompt doesn’t just activate features for “biology” — it sets off a chain reaction. The “biology” feature interacts with others: “evolution,” “Darwin,” “ethics,” “reasoning,” and eventually, “philosophy.” Using <strong>token-by-token attribution graphs</strong>, Anthropic visualizes how one thought <strong>cascades</strong> through the network.</p>

<p>These “thought chains” aren’t linear. Some tokens reinforce earlier ideas. Others suppress or redirect them. Concepts may disappear temporarily, only to resurface later with stronger activation — a kind of <strong>working memory</strong>. This dynamic flow is what Anthropic now calls <em>thought tracing</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-model-that-strategizes-yes--and-we-can-watch-it">A Model That Strategizes? Yes — and We Can Watch It</h2>

<p>Just like in the earlier poetry example, Claude doesn’t merely complete sentences — it <strong>plans</strong>. In the new study, the researchers show how the model can begin forming a mental structure even before certain tokens are generated.</p>

<p>For instance, features related to “ethics” might activate <strong>before</strong> the word appears, because the model anticipates its relevance to “biology + philosophy.” Attribution graphs reveal how these anticipations manifest as <strong>early activations</strong> of supporting features, which then guide downstream generation.</p>

<p>This is a profound shift in how we think about LLMs: not as reactionary next-word predictors, but as <strong>goal-conditioned planners</strong>. And now, we can trace those goals step-by-step.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-second-brain-inside-claude">A Second Brain Inside Claude</h2>

<p>So what exactly is being revealed here?</p>

<p>The new article essentially treats the LLM as a <strong>second brain</strong> — not just in metaphor, but in methodology. Where the original paper mapped the “organs” (modular circuits), this one traces <strong>synaptic firing</strong> across those modules in real time.</p>

<p>It’s a neuroscience-inspired look at AI, and it suggests that Claude builds meaning not by memorizing facts, but by <strong>composing them dynamically</strong> across internal systems.</p>

<p>In this way, “thought” becomes not a static activation, but a <strong>trajectory</strong> — a living path formed and updated as the model processes the prompt.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prompting-with-precision-the-future-of-language-engineering">Prompting with Precision: The Future of Language Engineering</h2>

<p>One practical implication? <strong>Prompt engineering could evolve into thought-path design.</strong></p>

<p>If we understand which phrases activate which paths, we could design prompts that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strengthen the recall of helpful circuits</li>
  <li>Suppress misleading associations</li>
  <li>Steer reasoning toward desired conclusions</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s no longer guesswork — it’s <strong>cognitive scaffolding</strong>.</p>

<p>This insight also holds promise for safety research. Tracing how harmful thoughts arise — and from which token or feature — gives us a tool to <strong>preempt hallucinations and jailbreaks</strong> with surgical precision.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-new-lens-for-interpretability">A New Lens for Interpretability</h2>

<p>In many ways, this new article doesn’t replace the original paper — it <strong>completes it</strong>.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Biology of a Language Model</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Tracing the Thoughts</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Maps internal features and circuits</td>
      <td>Traces real-time activation of those features</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Inspired by cognition</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Together, they shift the view of LLMs from static black boxes to <strong>living systems</strong> — ones that can be studied, debugged, and potentially aligned more deeply with human values.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There’s something quietly radical about this line of research.</p>

<p>Not long ago, we believed language models were statistical parrots. Then we found circuits. Now we see thoughts. It’s a reminder that <strong>intelligence isn’t magic — it’s mechanics</strong>. And with the right tools, even the most complex digital minds can be understood.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s new work marks a step toward <em>transparent cognition</em> — not just knowing <em>what</em> a model says, but <em>why</em> it thinks it.</p>

<p>And once we understand that… maybe we’re not so far from building models that can explain themselves — to us, and perhaps, even to each other.</p>

<p>In the age of large language models, capability often outpaces comprehension. Models like Claude 3.5 can write poetry, solve logic puzzles, and navigate multilingual queries — but we still don’t fully understand <em>how</em>. Beneath their fluent outputs lies a vast architecture of layers, weights, and attention heads that, until recently, remained largely inscrutable.</p>

<p>The story of the Inception architecture is one of ingenuity, iteration, and elegance in the field of deep learning. At a time when researchers were obsessed with increasing the depth and complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy on large-scale visual tasks, Google’s research team asked a different question: How can we go deeper without paying the full computational price? The answer was Inception—a family of architectures that offered a bold new design paradigm, prioritizing both <strong>computational efficiency and representational power</strong>. From <strong>Inception v1 (GoogLeNet)</strong> to <strong>Inception-ResNet v2</strong>, each version brought transformative ideas that would ripple throughout the deep learning community. This post unpacks the entire journey, layer by layer, innovation by innovation.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, artificial intelligence was still stumbling in the dark when it came to understanding images. Researchers had built systems that could play chess or perform basic language tasks, but when it came to something a toddler could do—like identifying a cat in a photo—machines struggled. There was a glaring gap between the potential of machine learning and its real-world applications in vision.</p>

<p>The field of adversarial machine learning is built on a paradox: models that perform impressively on natural data can be shockingly vulnerable to small, human-imperceptible perturbations. These adversarial examples expose a fragility in deep networks that could have serious consequences in security-critical domains like autonomous driving, medical imaging, or biometric authentication. Naturally, defenses against these attacks have been the subject of intense research. Among them, a seemingly simple strategy has gained popularity: <strong>random transformations</strong>. By applying random, often non-differentiable perturbations to input images—such as resizing, padding, cropping, JPEG compression, or color quantization—these methods hope to break the adversary’s control over the gradients that guide attacks. At first glance, it seems effective. Robust accuracy increases. Attacks fail. But is this robustness genuine?</p>

Among these, <strong>AlexNet</strong> and <strong>ResNet</strong> stand out as monumental contributions that shifted the paradigm of computer vision and image classification. Though separated by just three years, these two architectures reflect fundamentally different eras of deep learning—AlexNet laid the groundwork for deep convolutional networks, while ResNet solved the pressing problems that deeper architectures introduced.</p>

<p>Modern astronomy has evolved into a data-driven science. With massive sky surveys like SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), Pan-STARRS, and the upcoming LSST producing petabytes of data, traditional approaches no 
longer suffice. Manual inspection and simplistic models simply can’t scale with this astronomical data deluge. Enter <strong>astroML</strong>, a library that bridges the gap between astronomy and modern machine learning. 
astroML is a Python-based library built on top of familiar scientific computing tools like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. But what sets it apart is its thoughtful design — tailored to real-world 
astronomical problems. From irregular time series to galaxy classification, astroML brings statistically sound and domain-specific tools to the fingertips of astronomers, physicists, and data scientists alike.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever interacted with ChatGPT, asked an AI to summarize a document, or translated a phrase using Google Translate, you’re experiencing the legacy of a paper that redefined modern artificial intelligence. 
Published in 2017 by Vaswani et al., the paper <strong>“Attention Is All You Need”</strong> introduced the world to the <strong>Transformer</strong> architecture. This seemingly simple idea — that attention mechanisms alone can model 
complex language patterns without relying on recurrence or convolutions — has since become the bedrock of nearly every major NLP system.</p>

<p><strong>A Deep Dive into Seal-Tools: The Dataset That Makes LLMs Smarter Agents</strong></p>

<p>Imagine asking your AI assistant to “book a flight to Paris, then schedule a taxi to the airport and convert the final bill to Euros.” Sounds simple, right? In reality, for most AI models, this isn’t just 
hard — it’s nearly impossible to get right without human babysitting.</p>

<p>That’s because tool use, chaining functions, and executing multi-step operations <strong>requires structured reasoning</strong>, parameter handling, and format control — things even the smartest LLMs struggle with today.</p>

<p>Tensors are fundamental mathematical objects that appear across various domains such as physics, computer science, and engineering. At their core, tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that generalize the 
concepts of scalars (single numbers), vectors (one-dimensional arrays), and matrices (two-dimensional arrays). Unlike simple arrays, tensors are not just containers of numbers—they come with transformation 
rules that allow them to describe physical phenomena in a way that remains consistent across coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation, summarization, and translation. Yet, as powerful as they are, 
these models often struggle when asked to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require deliberate planning and interaction with external information sources. Traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting enables LLMs to articulate intermediate reasoning steps, but it remains confined to the model’s internal knowledge and inference capabilities. Conversely, action-based approaches have allowed 
models to execute external operations—such as querying an API or navigating an environment—but lack explicit internal reasoning, leading to unexplainable or brittle behavior. The ReAct framework addresses 
this gap by synergizing reasoning and acting in a unified prompt-based paradigm that interleaves “thoughts” and “actions” to solve complex tasks more effectively and transparently.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have transformed natural language understanding by memorizing vast amounts of text. Yet, when faced with questions that require <strong>combining</strong> multiple pieces 
of knowledge—so-called <em>compositional reasoning</em>—even the biggest models stumble. In their paper <em>Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models</em>, Press et al. introduce a new metric
for this shortfall, show that it persists despite model scale, and propose practical prompting techniques to close it.</p>

<p>As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LLaMA, and BERT continue to grow in size and influence, one challenge becomes increasingly apparent: while these models offer exceptional capabilities, 
<strong>adapting them for new tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive</strong>. Fine-tuning a model with billions of parameters typically requires large datasets, massive compute power, 
and hours or even days of training time — luxuries not everyone can afford.</p>

<p>So, you’ve got your hands on a fancy pre-trained language model. Great. It’s read more text than any human ever will, speaks in Shakespearean iambic pentameter <em>and</em> Python, and can tell you the capital of Burkina Faso at 3 AM.</p>
