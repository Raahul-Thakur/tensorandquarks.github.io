<p>In the age of large language models, capability often outpaces comprehension.

Beneath their fluent outputs lies a vast architecture of layers, weights, and attention heads that, until recently, remained largely inscrutable.</p>

<p>The story of the Inception architecture is one of ingenuity, iteration, and elegance in the field of deep learning. At a time when researchers were obsessed with increasing the depth and complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy on large-scale visual tasks, Google’s research team asked a different question: How can we go deeper without paying the full computational price? The answer was Inception—a family of architectures that offered a bold new design paradigm, prioritizing both <strong>computational efficiency and representational power</strong>. From <strong>Inception v1 (GoogLeNet)</strong> to <strong>Inception-ResNet v2</strong>, each version brought transformative ideas that would ripple throughout the deep learning community. This post unpacks the entire journey, layer by layer, innovation by innovation.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, artificial intelligence was still stumbling in the dark when it came to understanding images. Researchers had built systems that could play chess or perform basic language tasks, but when it came to something a toddler could do—like identifying a cat in a photo—machines struggled. There was a glaring gap between the potential of machine learning and its real-world applications in vision.</p>

<p>The field of adversarial machine learning is built on a paradox: models that perform impressively on natural data can be shockingly vulnerable to small, human-imperceptible perturbations. These adversarial examples expose a fragility in deep networks that could have serious consequences in security-critical domains like autonomous driving, medical imaging, or biometric authentication. Naturally, defenses against these attacks have been the subject of intense research. Among them, a seemingly simple strategy has gained popularity: <strong>random transformations</strong>. By applying random, often non-differentiable perturbations to input images—such as resizing, padding, cropping, JPEG compression, or color quantization—these methods hope to break the adversary’s control over the gradients that guide attacks. At first glance, it seems effective. Robust accuracy increases. Attacks fail. But is this robustness genuine?</p>

These powerful models can effortlessly handle tasks from writing articles to solving complex reasoning problems. Yet, as these models become smarter, ensuring they’re behaving as intended is becoming harder for humans alone.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of deep learning, certain architectures have defined turning points in how neural networks are designed, trained, and understood. Among these, <strong>AlexNet</strong> and <strong>ResNet</strong> stand out as monumental contributions that shifted the paradigm of computer vision and image classification. Though separated by just three years, these two architectures reflect fundamentally different eras of deep learning—AlexNet laid the groundwork for deep convolutional networks, while ResNet solved the pressing problems that deeper architectures introduced.</p>

<p>Modern astronomy has evolved into a data-driven science. With massive sky surveys like SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), Pan-STARRS, and the upcoming LSST producing petabytes of data, traditional approaches no 
longer suffice. Manual inspection and simplistic models simply can’t scale with this astronomical data deluge. Enter <strong>astroML</strong>, a library that bridges the gap between astronomy and modern machine learning. 
astroML is a Python-based library built on top of familiar scientific computing tools like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. But what sets it apart is its thoughtful design — tailored to real-world 
astronomical problems. From irregular time series to galaxy classification, astroML brings statistically sound and domain-specific tools to the fingertips of astronomers, physicists, and data scientists alike.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever interacted with ChatGPT, asked an AI to summarize a document, or translated a phrase using Google Translate, you’re experiencing the legacy of a paper that redefined modern artificial intelligence. 
Published in 2017 by Vaswani et al., the paper <strong>“Attention Is All You Need”</strong> introduced the world to the <strong>Transformer</strong> architecture. This seemingly simple idea — that attention mechanisms alone can model 
complex language patterns without relying on recurrence or convolutions — has since become the bedrock of nearly every major NLP system.</p>

hard — it’s nearly impossible to get right without human babysitting.</p>

<p>That’s because tool use, chaining functions, and executing multi-step operations <strong>requires structured reasoning</strong>, parameter handling, and format control — things even the smartest LLMs struggle with today.</p>

concepts of scalars (single numbers), vectors (one-dimensional arrays), and matrices (two-dimensional arrays). Unlike simple arrays, tensors are not just containers of numbers—they come with transformation 
rules that allow them to describe physical phenomena in a way that remains consistent across coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation, summarization, and translation. Yet, as powerful as they are, 
these models often struggle when asked to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require deliberate planning and interaction with external information sources. Traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting enables LLMs to articulate intermediate reasoning steps, but it remains confined to the model’s internal knowledge and inference capabilities. Conversely, action-based approaches have allowed 
models to execute external operations—such as querying an API or navigating an environment—but lack explicit internal reasoning, leading to unexplainable or brittle behavior. The ReAct framework addresses 
this gap by synergizing reasoning and acting in a unified prompt-based paradigm that interleaves “thoughts” and “actions” to solve complex tasks more effectively and transparently.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have transformed natural language understanding by memorizing vast amounts of text. Yet, when faced with questions that require <strong>combining</strong> multiple pieces 
of knowledge—so-called <em>compositional reasoning</em>—even the biggest models stumble. In their paper <em>Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models</em>, Press et al. introduce a new metric
for this shortfall, show that it persists despite model scale, and propose practical prompting techniques to close it.</p>
