<h2 id="my-introduction">My Introduction</h2>
<p>ChatGPT has become a part of our daily lives in ways we could not have imagined just a few years ago. From writing emails and polishing presentations to generating working code for side projects, it has become a universal assistant. But beyond these everyday tasks, what are the true capabilities of models like ChatGPT and its successors? Can they go beyond imitating human output and actually contribute to fields that demand creativity and rigor‚Äîlike mathematics? This question is at the heart of a recent research paper, <em>G√∂del Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures?</em> published just a week ago. The paper does not ask whether large language models can memorize or recall results, but whether they can engage in something far more ambitious: creating new mathematics. In this blog, I want to walk through what the paper does, why it matters, and what it means for the future of artificial intelligence and mathematical discovery.</p>

<p><em>How do we teach machines to understand the shape of a 3D object‚Äîno matter how it‚Äôs viewed? This new research shows that letting the model ‚Äúlearn from its own mistakes‚Äù may be the answer.</em></p>

<p>In the realm of computer vision and 3D understanding, one of the longstanding challenges is teaching machines how to reconstruct a 3D object from 2D images. If you‚Äôve ever seen photogrammetry tools turn a set of photos into a 3D model, you already know the basic idea. But beneath the surface, there‚Äôs a major problem: these models often perform well only when the images are captured from familiar angles. Once the camera moves to a new, unseen position, the model starts to stumble.</p>

<p>In the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence, language models are no longer just powerful tools for answering questions or summarizing text. They‚Äôre evolving into intelligent agents capable of reasoning, planning, interacting with other agents, and autonomously executing complex tasks. But as the complexity of these agent systems grows, so does the need for <strong>standards</strong> that ensure consistency, interoperability, and scalability.</p>

<p>The story of the Inception architecture is one of ingenuity, iteration, and elegance in the field of deep learning. At a time when researchers were obsessed with increasing the depth and complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy on large-scale visual tasks, Google‚Äôs research team asked a different question: How can we go deeper without paying the full computational price? The answer was Inception‚Äîa family of architectures that offered a bold new design paradigm, prioritizing both <strong>computational efficiency and representational power</strong>. From <strong>Inception v1 (GoogLeNet)</strong> to <strong>Inception-ResNet v2</strong>, each version brought transformative ideas that would ripple throughout the deep learning community. This post unpacks the entire journey, layer by layer, innovation by innovation.</p>

There was a glaring gap between the potential of machine learning and its real-world applications in vision.</p>

<p>The field of adversarial machine learning is built on a paradox: models that perform impressively on natural data can be shockingly vulnerable to small, human-imperceptible perturbations. These adversarial examples expose a fragility in deep networks that could have serious consequences in security-critical domains like autonomous driving, medical imaging, or biometric authentication. Naturally, defenses against these attacks have been the subject of intense research. Among them, a seemingly simple strategy has gained popularity: <strong>random transformations</strong>. By applying random, often non-differentiable perturbations to input images‚Äîsuch as resizing, padding, cropping, JPEG compression, or color quantization‚Äîthese methods hope to break the adversary‚Äôs control over the gradients that guide attacks. At first glance, it seems effective. Robust accuracy increases. Attacks fail. But is this robustness genuine?</p>

astroML is a Python-based library built on top of familiar scientific computing tools like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. But what sets it apart is its thoughtful design ‚Äî tailored to real-world 
astronomical problems. From irregular time series to galaxy classification, astroML brings statistically sound and domain-specific tools to the fingertips of astronomers, physicists, and data scientists alike.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve ever interacted with ChatGPT, asked an AI to summarize a document, or translated a phrase using Google Translate, you‚Äôre experiencing the legacy of a paper that redefined modern artificial intelligence. 
Published in 2017 by Vaswani et al., the paper <strong>‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù</strong> introduced the world to the <strong>Transformer</strong> architecture. This seemingly simple idea ‚Äî that attention mechanisms alone can model 
complex language patterns without relying on recurrence or convolutions ‚Äî has since become the bedrock of nearly every major NLP system.</p>

<p>Imagine asking your AI assistant to ‚Äúbook a flight to Paris, then schedule a taxi to the airport and convert the final bill to Euros.‚Äù Sounds simple, right? In reality, for most AI models, this isn‚Äôt just 
hard ‚Äî it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get right without human babysitting.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs because tool use, chaining functions, and executing multi-step operations <strong>requires structured reasoning</strong>, parameter handling, and format control ‚Äî things even the smartest LLMs struggle with today.</p>

<p>Tensors are fundamental mathematical objects that appear across various domains such as physics, computer science, and engineering. At their core, tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that generalize the 
concepts of scalars (single numbers), vectors (one-dimensional arrays), and matrices (two-dimensional arrays). Unlike simple arrays, tensors are not just containers of numbers‚Äîthey come with transformation 
rules that allow them to describe physical phenomena in a way that remains consistent across coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation, summarization, and translation. Yet, as powerful as they are, 
these models often struggle when asked to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require deliberate planning and interaction with external information sources. Traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting enables LLMs to articulate intermediate reasoning steps, but it remains confined to the model‚Äôs internal knowledge and inference capabilities. Conversely, action-based approaches have allowed 
models to execute external operations‚Äîsuch as querying an API or navigating an environment‚Äîbut lack explicit internal reasoning, leading to unexplainable or brittle behavior. The ReAct framework addresses 
this gap by synergizing reasoning and acting in a unified prompt-based paradigm that interleaves ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù and ‚Äúactions‚Äù to solve complex tasks more effectively and transparently.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have transformed natural language understanding by memorizing vast amounts of text. Yet, when faced with questions that require <strong>combining</strong> multiple pieces 
of knowledge‚Äîso-called <em>compositional reasoning</em>‚Äîeven the biggest models stumble. In their paper <em>Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models</em>, Press et al. introduce a new metric
for this shortfall, show that it persists despite model scale, and propose practical prompting techniques to close it.</p>

<p>As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LLaMA, and BERT continue to grow in size and influence, one challenge becomes increasingly apparent: while these models offer exceptional capabilities, 
<strong>adapting them for new tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive</strong>. Fine-tuning a model with billions of parameters typically requires large datasets, massive compute power, 
and hours or even days of training time ‚Äî luxuries not everyone can afford.</p>
