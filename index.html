<h2 id="abstract--overview">Abstract / Overview</h2>

<p>AlphaEvolve, developed by Google DeepMind, is an evolutionary coding agent designed to autonomously discover and optimize algorithms. Unlike single-model LLM setups, it orchestrates a pipeline of large language models that iteratively modify, test, and refine code. Each iteration is evaluated automatically, forming a feedback loop that resembles biological evolution: mutation, evaluation, and selection. This self-improving process has yielded breakthroughs across mathematics, engineering, and AI infrastructure. Notably, AlphaEvolve discovered the first improvement in matrix-multiplication algorithms in <strong>56 years</strong>, reducing the number of scalar multiplications for 4√ó4 complex matrices from 49 to 48. Beyond pure theory, it optimized Google‚Äôs data-center scheduling, TPU circuit design, and LLM training kernels, leading to measurable efficiency gains. The system generalizes the idea of FunSearch by evolving entire codebases rather than single functions and can operate across multiple programming languages and evaluation metrics. AlphaEvolve represents a leap toward automated scientific discovery, merging symbolic reasoning, code synthesis, and performance-driven learning within a unified framework. Its hybrid of evolutionary computation and LLM-based creativity reveals that machine-guided code evolution can rival and sometimes surpass decades of human optimization in mathematics and systems engineering.</p>

<p>ChatGPT has become a part of our daily lives in ways we could not have imagined just a few years ago. From writing emails and polishing presentations to generating working code for side projects, it has become a universal assistant. But beyond these everyday tasks, what are the true capabilities of models like ChatGPT and its successors? Can they go beyond imitating human output and actually contribute to fields that demand creativity and rigor‚Äîlike mathematics? This question is at the heart of a recent research paper, <em>G√∂del Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures?</em> published just a week ago. The paper does not ask whether large language models can memorize or recall results, but whether they can engage in something far more ambitious: creating new mathematics. In this blog, I want to walk through what the paper does, why it matters, and what it means for the future of artificial intelligence and mathematical discovery.</p>

<h2 id="precursor-why-the-higgs-story-matters">Precursor: Why the Higgs Story Matters</h2>

<p>For more than half a century, physicists chased one gap in an otherwise triumphant theory. The Standard Model (SM) precisely describes quarks and leptons and the forces among them, yet it left a conceptual hole: why are the W and Z bosons heavy while the photon is massless? The Higgs mechanism answered this by positing a scalar field that permeates all of space. Particles interacting with this field acquire mass; particles that do not remain massless. Fluctuations of the field appear as a new particle‚Äîthe Higgs boson.</p>
