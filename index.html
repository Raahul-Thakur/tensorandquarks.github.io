      <p><h1 id="the-random-illusion-why-adversarial-defenses-arent-as-robust-as-they-seem">The Random Illusion: Why Adversarial Defenses Aren‚Äôt as Robust as They Seem</h1>

<p>The field of adversarial machine learning is built on a paradox: models that perform impressively on natural data can be shockingly vulnerable to small, human-imperceptible perturbations. These adversarial examples expose a fragility in deep networks that could have serious consequences in security-critical domains like autonomous driving, medical imaging, or biometric authentication. Naturally, defenses against these attacks have been the subject of intense research. Among them, a seemingly simple strategy has gained popularity: <strong>random transformations</strong>. By applying random, often non-differentiable perturbations to input images‚Äîsuch as resizing, padding, cropping, JPEG compression, or color quantization‚Äîthese methods hope to break the adversary‚Äôs control over the gradients that guide attacks. At first glance, it seems effective. Robust accuracy increases. Attacks fail. But is this robustness genuine?</p>

<p>This question forms the heart of the paper <em>‚ÄúDemystifying the Adversarial Robustness of Random Transformation Defenses‚Äù</em> by Bai et al. (2022). The authors critically re-examine the perceived robustness of these defenses. Their work builds a theoretical and empirical foundation to investigate whether random transformation (RT) defenses provide true robustness or merely present an illusion by obfuscating gradients and making attacks harder to execute. Through a combination of analytical modeling and rigorous adaptive attacks, they show that what looks like security is often just an artifact of incomplete threat models.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-random-transformation-defenses">What Are Random Transformation Defenses?</h2>

<p>RT defenses work by applying a stochastic transformation <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T(x)</code> to the input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> before feeding it into a model <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code>. This transformation is sampled from a distribution <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ùíØ</code>, and the model predicts based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(T(x))</code>. The hope is that even if an adversary perturbs the original image <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>, the transformation might distort or nullify that perturbation‚Äôs effect.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an intuitive logic behind this: if the adversarial perturbation is tightly tailored to a specific input instance, applying random augmentations or corruptions might ‚Äúshake it loose.‚Äù Moreover, some transformations‚Äîlike JPEG compression‚Äîare non-differentiable, which can interfere with the gradient-based optimization that underlies most modern adversarial attacks.</p>

<p>But intuition isn‚Äôt proof. And it turns out that when attackers are properly equipped, they can pierce the veil of these defenses.</p>

<h2 id="full-information-adversaries-and-eot-attacks">Full-Information Adversaries and EOT Attacks</h2>

<p>A key contribution of the paper is defining a strong and realistic <strong>threat model</strong>. Here, the attacker knows the transformation distribution <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ùíØ</code>, has access to model gradients, and optimizes:</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\text{maximize} \quad &amp; \mathbb{E}_{T \sim \mathcal{T}} \left[ \ell(f(T(x + \delta)), y) \right] \\
\text{subject to} \quad &amp; \|\delta\| \leq \epsilon
\end{aligned}\]

<p>This is the <strong>Expectation Over Transformation (EOT)</strong> attack. It was introduced by Athalye et al. in 2018 and works by averaging gradients over multiple transformation samples. Many prior defenses were tested against weak, non-adaptive attacks. But once EOT is used, the perceived robustness of these RT defenses collapses.</p>

<h2 id="theory-what-random-transformations-actually-do">Theory: What Random Transformations Actually Do</h2>

<p>The paper rigorously proves that RT defenses do <strong>not</strong> remove adversarial examples. Instead, they convolve the loss landscape with the transformation distribution, creating a smoothed version. This changes gradient directions slightly and slows down naive attacks‚Äîbut an adaptive attacker can still find vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Moreover, the theory dispels a major misconception: random transformations do <strong>not</strong> push inputs out of the adversarial cone. The adversarial directions remain close. RTs may distort the path to the boundary but not its existence.</p>

<p>This insight is crucial: any perceived robustness is an illusion created by <strong>gradient obfuscation</strong>, not true geometric changes.</p>

<h2 id="experiments-when-defenses-fail">Experiments: When Defenses Fail</h2>

<p>The authors evaluate common RT defenses like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Random Resize &amp; Pad (R&amp;P)</li>
  <li>JPEG Compression</li>
  <li>Bit Depth Reduction</li>
</ul>

<p>Across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, they compare robust accuracy under non-adaptive and adaptive EOT attacks. Results are stark:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Defense</th>
      <th>Robust Acc (naive)</th>
      <th>Robust Acc (EOT)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>JPEG Compression</td>
      <td>~50%</td>
      <td>~5‚Äì10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resize and Padding</td>
      <td>~40‚Äì45%</td>
      <td>~2‚Äì8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bit Depth Reduction</td>
      <td>~30%</td>
      <td>~1‚Äì5%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Clearly, RT defenses fall apart under proper attack conditions. The illusion of security is broken when the adversary adapts to the defense.</p>

<h2 id="geometry--visualizations">Geometry &amp; Visualizations</h2>

<p>The paper also explores adversarial geometry. Using visualizations and decision boundary proximity metrics, they show that adversarial examples persist across transformations. The decision boundaries themselves aren‚Äôt significantly altered.</p>

<p>This dismantles the notion that RTs ‚Äúreshape‚Äù the input space. Instead, they merely add noise‚Äînoise that adaptive attackers can average out.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-paper-doesnt-cover">What the Paper Doesn‚Äôt Cover</h2>

<p>Despite its rigor, the paper leaves a few areas underexplored:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Query-Limited Settings:</strong> Real-world attackers may not have access to unlimited samples. RTs could offer some practical robustness by increasing attack cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Training-Time Use:</strong> What happens if RTs are used during adversarial training? The paper only explores test-time application.</li>
  <li><strong>Perceptual Defense:</strong> RTs like JPEG may make adversarial examples less perceptible. The paper doesn‚Äôt evaluate human perception.</li>
  <li><strong>Learnable Transformations:</strong> Modern augmentation techniques (AutoAugment, RandAugment) might offer better protection than handcrafted RTs.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The message from this paper is loud and clear: <strong>robustness must be measured under adaptive, full-information attacks.</strong> RT defenses appear to work only when attackers aren‚Äôt trying hard enough. Once you account for this, the robustness vanishes.</p>

<p>The takeaway? If we want trustworthy models, we must move beyond random patches and toward principled defenses‚Äîcertified training, robust optimization, and transparent evaluation.</p>

<p>Imagine rewinding the Universe until every galaxy, atom and photon collapses into a single blinding flash. Is that primal flash a howling chaos or an eerie stillness? In 1979 Roger Penrose wagered on stillness, proposing that the <em>Weyl tensor</em>‚Äîthe slice of curvature that stores tidal distortions and gravitational waves‚Äîwas precisely zero at the Big Bang. Four decades later two very different papers revisit his bet. One rewrites Einstein‚Äôs equations so the <strong>zero-Weyl</strong> state drops out of geometry itself; the other unleashes quantum back-reaction that actively <em>damps</em> any distortion away. Which path makes a smooth dawn more believable?</p>

<p>What is the shape of the universe? Is it infinite or finite but unbounded, like a video game world that wraps around on itself? While general relativity has given us profound insights into the local curvature of spacetime, it leaves unanswered the question of the universe‚Äôs global shape. In her 2001 paper, <em>Topology and the Cosmic Microwave Background</em>, Janna Levin explores how cosmology and topology intersect‚Äîhow the universe‚Äôs large-scale connectivity might be imprinted in the faint glow of the early universe: the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This paper not only bridges mathematics and astrophysics but also pushes the philosophical boundary between what can be known and what must remain an assumption.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve ever interacted with ChatGPT, asked an AI to summarize a document, or translated a phrase using Google Translate, you‚Äôre experiencing the legacy of a paper that redefined modern artificial intelligence. 
Published in 2017 by Vaswani et al., the paper <strong>‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù</strong> introduced the world to the <strong>Transformer</strong> architecture. This seemingly simple idea ‚Äî that attention mechanisms alone can model 
complex language patterns without relying on recurrence or convolutions ‚Äî has since become the bedrock of nearly every major NLP system.</p>

<p>On February 23, 1987, astronomers witnessed something extraordinary. A massive blue supergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud went supernova. Its light was dazzling, but for physicists, the real treasure arrived 
hours earlier‚Äîin the form of 19 ghostly signals captured by two underground neutrino detectors. This was <strong>Supernova 1987A</strong>, the closest observed supernova in nearly four centuries and the first ever accompanied
by direct neutrino detections. These few dozen elusive particles validated decades of theoretical work in core-collapse physics and marked the beginning of what we now call multi-messenger astronomy.</p>

<p>Yet, more than 35 years later, our best simulations‚Äîarmed with full general relativity, detailed microphysics, and modern computing power‚Äîstill <strong>cannot reproduce what those neutrino detectors saw</strong> in 1987.</p>

<p>Tensors are fundamental mathematical objects that appear across various domains such as physics, computer science, and engineering. At their core, tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that generalize the 
concepts of scalars (single numbers), vectors (one-dimensional arrays), and matrices (two-dimensional arrays). Unlike simple arrays, tensors are not just containers of numbers‚Äîthey come with transformation 
rules that allow them to describe physical phenomena in a way that remains consistent across coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation, summarization, and translation. Yet, as powerful as they are, 
these models often struggle when asked to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require deliberate planning and interaction with external information sources. Traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting enables LLMs to articulate intermediate reasoning steps, but it remains confined to the model‚Äôs internal knowledge and inference capabilities. Conversely, action-based approaches have allowed 
models to execute external operations‚Äîsuch as querying an API or navigating an environment‚Äîbut lack explicit internal reasoning, leading to unexplainable or brittle behavior. The ReAct framework addresses 
this gap by synergizing reasoning and acting in a unified prompt-based paradigm that interleaves ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù and ‚Äúactions‚Äù to solve complex tasks more effectively and transparently.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have transformed natural language understanding by memorizing vast amounts of text. Yet, when faced with questions that require <strong>combining</strong> multiple pieces 
of knowledge‚Äîso-called <em>compositional reasoning</em>‚Äîeven the biggest models stumble. In their paper <em>Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models</em>, Press et al. introduce a new metric
for this shortfall, show that it persists despite model scale, and propose practical prompting techniques to close it.</p>

<p>As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LLaMA, and BERT continue to grow in size and influence, one challenge becomes increasingly apparent: while these models offer exceptional capabilities, 
<strong>adapting them for new tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive</strong>. Fine-tuning a model with billions of parameters typically requires large datasets, massive compute power, 
and hours or even days of training time ‚Äî luxuries not everyone can afford.</p>
