<p>The field of adversarial machine learning is built on a paradox: models that perform impressively on natural data can be shockingly vulnerable to small, human-imperceptible perturbations. These adversarial examples expose a fragility in deep networks that could have serious consequences in security-critical domains like autonomous driving, medical imaging, or biometric authentication. Naturally, defenses against these attacks have been the subject of intense research. Among them, a seemingly simple strategy has gained popularity: <strong>random transformations</strong>. By applying random, often non-differentiable perturbations to input images‚Äîsuch as resizing, padding, cropping, JPEG compression, or color quantization‚Äîthese methods hope to break the adversary‚Äôs control over the gradients that guide attacks. At first glance, it seems effective. Robust accuracy increases. Attacks fail. But is this robustness genuine?</p>

<p>Imagine rewinding the Universe until every galaxy, atom and photon collapses into a single blinding flash. Is that primal flash a howling chaos or an eerie stillness? In 1979 Roger Penrose wagered on stillness, proposing that the <em>Weyl tensor</em>‚Äîthe slice of curvature that stores tidal distortions and gravitational waves‚Äîwas precisely zero at the Big Bang. Four decades later two very different papers revisit his bet. One rewrites Einstein‚Äôs equations so the <strong>zero-Weyl</strong> state drops out of geometry itself; the other unleashes quantum back-reaction that actively <em>damps</em> any distortion away. Which path makes a smooth dawn more believable?</p>

<p>Time travel is a fascinating concept ‚Äî the stuff of science fiction and countless philosophical puzzles. But sometimes, the idea creeps into legitimate physics. Not as a machine or paradox, but as a byproduct of how we define time and causality in the first place. The paper <em>Back to the Future: Causality on a Moving Braneworld</em> ventures into this territory, asking what happens to causality ‚Äî the idea that cause comes before effect ‚Äî when our entire universe isn‚Äôt stationary but moves through a higher-dimensional space.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>What is the shape of the universe? Is it infinite or finite but unbounded, like a video game world that wraps around on itself? While general relativity has given us profound insights into the local curvature of spacetime, it leaves unanswered the question of the universe‚Äôs global shape. In her 2001 paper, <em>Topology and the Cosmic Microwave Background</em>, Janna Levin explores how cosmology and topology intersect‚Äîhow the universe‚Äôs large-scale connectivity might be imprinted in the faint glow of the early universe: the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This paper not only bridges mathematics and astrophysics but also pushes the philosophical boundary between what can be known and what must remain an assumption.</p>

<p>For centuries, humanity has observed the Sun ‚Äî tracking sunspots, solar flares, and cycles of activity.

The authors argue that the solar poles hold vital clues to the Sun‚Äôs magnetic field generation, its cycle, and the behavior of space weather.</p>

astroML is a Python-based library built on top of familiar scientific computing tools like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. But what sets it apart is its thoughtful design ‚Äî tailored to real-world

hours earlier‚Äîin the form of 19 ghostly signals captured by two underground neutrino detectors. This was <strong>Supernova 1987A</strong>, the closest observed supernova in nearly four centuries and the first ever accompanied
by direct neutrino detections. These few dozen elusive particles validated decades of theoretical work in core-collapse physics and marked the beginning of what we now call multi-messenger astronomy.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation, summarization, and translation. Yet, as powerful as they are, 
these models often struggle when asked to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require deliberate planning and interaction with external information sources. Traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting enables LLMs to articulate intermediate reasoning steps, but it remains confined to the model‚Äôs internal knowledge and inference capabilities. Conversely, action-based approaches have allowed 
models to execute external operations‚Äîsuch as querying an API or navigating an environment‚Äîbut lack explicit internal reasoning, leading to unexplainable or brittle behavior. The ReAct framework addresses 
this gap by synergizing reasoning and acting in a unified prompt-based paradigm that interleaves ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù and ‚Äúactions‚Äù to solve complex tasks more effectively and transparently.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have transformed natural language understanding by memorizing vast amounts of text. Yet, when faced with questions that require <strong>combining</strong> multiple pieces 
of knowledge‚Äîso-called <em>compositional reasoning</em>‚Äîeven the biggest models stumble. In their paper <em>Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models</em>, Press et al. introduce a new metric
for this shortfall, show that it persists despite model scale, and propose practical prompting techniques to close it.</p>

<p>As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LLaMA, and BERT continue to grow in size and influence, one challenge becomes increasingly apparent: while these models offer exceptional capabilities, 
<strong>adapting them for new tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive</strong>. Fine-tuning a model with billions of parameters typically requires large datasets, massive compute power, 
and hours or even days of training time ‚Äî luxuries not everyone can afford.</p>
