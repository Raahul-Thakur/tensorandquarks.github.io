<hr />

<p>This was my assignment for a university coursework module, where I was tasked to evaluate the likelihood of humans colonising Mars within the next 50 years. As someone fascinated by space exploration and future technologies, this topic struck a chord with me. What began as a research task soon turned into a deep dive into the science, speculation, and possibilities surrounding Mars colonisation. Here’s what I found.</p>

<p>For centuries, humanity has observed the Sun — tracking sunspots, solar flares, and cycles of activity. Telescopes, space observatories, and satellites have offered remarkable insights into our star’s behavior. Yet, an entire region of the Sun remains practically unexplored: its poles. The paper titled <em>“Exploring the Solar Poles: The Last Great Frontier of the Sun”</em> (Nandy et al., 2023) sets out to emphasize just how critical this overlooked region is to understanding the inner workings of our star. The authors argue that the solar poles hold vital clues to the Sun’s magnetic field generation, its cycle, and the behavior of space weather.</p>

<h2 id="the-astronomers-new-toolbox">The Astronomer’s New Toolbox</h2>

<p>Modern astronomy has evolved into a data-driven science. With massive sky surveys like SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), Pan-STARRS, and the upcoming LSST producing petabytes of data, traditional approaches no 
longer suffice. Manual inspection and simplistic models simply can’t scale with this astronomical data deluge. Enter <strong>astroML</strong>, a library that bridges the gap between astronomy and modern machine learning. 
astroML is a Python-based library built on top of familiar scientific computing tools like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. But what sets it apart is its thoughtful design — tailored to real-world 
astronomical problems. From irregular time series to galaxy classification, astroML brings statistically sound and domain-specific tools to the fingertips of astronomers, physicists, and data scientists alike.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever interacted with ChatGPT, asked an AI to summarize a document, or translated a phrase using Google Translate, you’re experiencing the legacy of a paper that redefined modern artificial intelligence. 
Published in 2017 by Vaswani et al., the paper <strong>“Attention Is All You Need”</strong> introduced the world to the <strong>Transformer</strong> architecture. This seemingly simple idea — that attention mechanisms alone can model 
complex language patterns without relying on recurrence or convolutions — has since become the bedrock of nearly every major NLP system.</p>

<p>On February 23, 1987, astronomers witnessed something extraordinary. A massive blue supergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud went supernova. Its light was dazzling, but for physicists, the real treasure arrived 
hours earlier—in the form of 19 ghostly signals captured by two underground neutrino detectors. This was <strong>Supernova 1987A</strong>, the closest observed supernova in nearly four centuries and the first ever accompanied
by direct neutrino detections. These few dozen elusive particles validated decades of theoretical work in core-collapse physics and marked the beginning of what we now call multi-messenger astronomy.</p>

<p>Yet, more than 35 years later, our best simulations—armed with full general relativity, detailed microphysics, and modern computing power—still <strong>cannot reproduce what those neutrino detectors saw</strong> in 1987.</p>

<p><strong>A Deep Dive into Seal-Tools: The Dataset That Makes LLMs Smarter Agents</strong></p>

<p>Imagine asking your AI assistant to “book a flight to Paris, then schedule a taxi to the airport and convert the final bill to Euros.” Sounds simple, right? In reality, for most AI models, this isn’t just 
hard — it’s nearly impossible to get right without human babysitting.</p>

<p>That’s because tool use, chaining functions, and executing multi-step operations <strong>requires structured reasoning</strong>, parameter handling, and format control — things even the smartest LLMs struggle with today.</p>

      <p><h1 id="what-are-tensors">What Are Tensors?</h1>

<p>Tensors are fundamental mathematical objects that appear across various domains such as physics, computer science, and engineering. At their core, tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that generalize the 
concepts of scalars (single numbers), vectors (one-dimensional arrays), and matrices (two-dimensional arrays). Unlike simple arrays, tensors are not just containers of numbers—they come with transformation 
rules that allow them to describe physical phenomena in a way that remains consistent across coordinate systems.</p>

      <p><h1 id="from-why-to-how-reacts-unified-reasoning-acting-paradigm">From “Why” to “How”: ReAct’s Unified Reasoning-Acting Paradigm</h1>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation, summarization, and translation. Yet, as powerful as they are, 
these models often struggle when asked to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require deliberate planning and interaction with external information sources. Traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting enables LLMs to articulate intermediate reasoning steps, but it remains confined to the model’s internal knowledge and inference capabilities. Conversely, action-based approaches have allowed 
models to execute external operations—such as querying an API or navigating an environment—but lack explicit internal reasoning, leading to unexplainable or brittle behavior. The ReAct framework addresses 
this gap by synergizing reasoning and acting in a unified prompt-based paradigm that interleaves “thoughts” and “actions” to solve complex tasks more effectively and transparently.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have transformed natural language understanding by memorizing vast amounts of text. Yet, when faced with questions that require <strong>combining</strong> multiple pieces 
of knowledge—so-called <em>compositional reasoning</em>—even the biggest models stumble. In their paper <em>Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models</em>, Press et al. introduce a new metric
for this shortfall, show that it persists despite model scale, and propose practical prompting techniques to close it.</p>

<p>As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LLaMA, and BERT continue to grow in size and influence, one challenge becomes increasingly apparent: while these models offer exceptional capabilities, 
<strong>adapting them for new tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive</strong>. Fine-tuning a model with billions of parameters typically requires large datasets, massive compute power, 
and hours or even days of training time — luxuries not everyone can afford.</p>
