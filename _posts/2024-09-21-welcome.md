This is the first post!  
Here I’ll share ideas in physics, AI, and their cosmic overlaps.

This is the place for thinkers, makers, and lifelong learners who are drawn to both the beauty of the laws of physics and the logic of machine learning. Whether it's a deep dive into cosmological models, neural networks inspired by nature, or the  dualities between entropy and information, this is where I'll explore the patterns that bridge science and computation.

What can you expect here?

Research Highlights — digestible insights from papers I’m reading
ML Concepts & Tutorials — demystifying complex ideas through simple code and clean intuition  
Physics Writeups — from quantum quirks to astrophysical simulations  
Creative Projects — where physics meets AI in practical (and sometimes poetic) ways

This is a journey rather than merely a compilation of posts. Curiosity and the love of learning are at the heart of all posts, whether they are technical or conceptual.

If you’ve ever wondered what black holes and backpropagation have in common, you’re in the right place.

Thanks for being here — and here’s to exploring the universe, one post at a time.
