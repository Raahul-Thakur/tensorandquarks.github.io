# Can We See the Shape of the Universe?

## 1. Introduction

What is the shape of the universe? Is it infinite or finite but unbounded, like a video game world that wraps around on itself? While general relativity has given us profound insights into the local curvature of spacetime, it leaves unanswered the question of the universe‚Äôs global shape. In her 2001 paper, *Topology and the Cosmic Microwave Background*, Janna Levin explores how cosmology and topology intersect‚Äîhow the universe‚Äôs large-scale connectivity might be imprinted in the faint glow of the early universe: the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This paper not only bridges mathematics and astrophysics but also pushes the philosophical boundary between what can be known and what must remain an assumption.

## 2. What the Paper Talks About

### I. Topology and Geometry

Levin begins by clearly distinguishing between *geometry* and *topology*. Geometry describes how space curves‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs flat, positively curved (spherical), or negatively curved (hyperbolic). Topology, on the other hand, defines how space is connected. Two spaces can have the same geometry but different topologies. For instance, Euclidean space ‚Ñù¬≥ and a 3-torus T¬≥ are both flat, but T¬≥ is compact and loops in all three dimensions. The key point here is that general relativity dictates local geometry but does not fix global topology. This opens the door to a vast number of possible finite universes, many of which are observationally testable.

### II. Survey of Compact Manifolds

Levin provides a concise survey of compact manifolds relevant to cosmology. Flat manifolds, such as the 3-torus, are the most tractable, as their eigenmodes are simply quantized plane waves. Spherical topologies are fewer in number and have been well-studied, but hyperbolic manifolds‚Äîspaces of constant negative curvature‚Äîadmit an infinite number of compact, non-simply connected possibilities. These hyperbolic spaces are much richer topologically and could provide a better fit to some anomalies seen in the CMB, though they are computationally more complex to analyze. Levin also references Mostow Rigidity, which makes hyperbolic topologies particularly unique, since their geometry is entirely determined by their topology.

### III. Standard Cosmology and the Cosmic Microwave Background

In standard ŒõCDM cosmology, the universe is typically modeled as simply connected and homogeneous. The CMB‚Äîthe afterglow of the Big Bang‚Äîacts as a snapshot of the universe at the time of last scattering. It is nearly uniform, but contains minute fluctuations that encode the density perturbations from the early universe. These temperature variations are analyzed via a spherical harmonic decomposition, giving rise to the angular power spectrum \( C_{\ell} \), which shows how fluctuations vary with angular scale. Levin highlights that the spectrum‚Äôs large-scale structure (low \( \ell \) modes) is particularly sensitive to global topology, since compactness restricts the allowable wavelengths.

### IV. Observing Flat Topologies in the CMB

For flat topologies like the 3-torus, Levin discusses the phenomenon of **matched circles in the sky**. If the universe is small and loops back on itself, then the surface of last scattering may intersect with itself, producing circular regions on the CMB map with identical temperature fluctuations. These pairs of circles would be located in different directions in the sky but would share identical patterns. The ‚Äúcircles-in-the-sky‚Äù method, proposed by Cornish, Spergel, and Starkman, remains one of the most compelling observational signatures of compact topology. Levin also discusses the suppression of large-scale modes in the angular power spectrum due to the finite size of space, another indirect signature of topology.

### V. Observing Hyperbolic Topologies in the CMB

Hyperbolic manifolds are more exotic. Although they offer richer topological structure, they are computationally harder to model because the eigenmodes of the Laplacian must be obtained numerically. Levin emphasizes that in hyperbolic universes, the temperature fluctuation patterns would be irregular and potentially chaotic due to the anisotropic geodesic structure. The ‚Äúcircles in the sky‚Äù method becomes less feasible in this context because such manifolds lack the regular repeating structure seen in toroidal spaces. However, Levin speculates that hyperbolic compactifications could help explain features such as the observed suppression of power at low multipoles‚Äîanomalies that have since been confirmed by WMAP and Planck.

### VI. Beyond Standard Cosmology

Levin briefly discusses how this topological framework may extend or challenge the assumptions of standard cosmology. While most cosmological models assume infinite space due to mathematical convenience, this is not physically necessary. Finite models with compact topologies could be equally valid‚Äîand, more importantly, testable. She argues that cosmologists should treat topology as a physical degree of freedom rather than a mathematical afterthought. This is a key philosophical shift: instead of assuming the universe is infinite, we should strive to find evidence for‚Äîor against‚Äîfiniteness.

## 3. Why Do We Need This Paper?

Levin‚Äôs paper was groundbreaking because it reframed cosmic topology as an *observational science*. At a time when few researchers were seriously exploring the testability of topological models, Levin laid out a clear roadmap for how such models could leave imprints on the CMB. The work is valuable not just for its theoretical depth, but also for its emphasis on observables: matched circles, power suppression, and mode discretization. Her call to "test infinity" rather than assume it is a rare philosophical stance in physics, one grounded in scientific pragmatism.

However, the paper does have its limits. While it thoroughly covers the theoretical motivations and possible signatures, it does not present concrete observational results or simulations. Also, while flat spaces are well-treated, hyperbolic spaces are acknowledged to be computationally difficult, and the analysis remains mostly qualitative. Later work would need to address these computational challenges through numerical simulations and statistical analyses.

## 4. Legacy and Future Work Inspired by This Paper

Levin‚Äôs work has served as a foundational reference for many follow-up studies. For instance:
- The ‚Äúcircles in the sky‚Äù search method was applied extensively in **WMAP** and **Planck** data, including works by Cornish et al. (2003), who tested various topologies using matched-filtering algorithms.
- Mathematicians like Jeffrey Weeks developed software (e.g., *CurvedSpaces*) to simulate compact hyperbolic universes and compute CMB predictions numerically.
- Some papers explored Bayesian frameworks for comparing compact vs. infinite models using CMB likelihoods (e.g., Aurich, Lustig, Steiner).
- The low-‚Ñì suppression anomaly seen in both WMAP and Planck data continues to be debated as a possible topological effect, with some pointing to toroidal or Picard horn topologies as plausible explanations.

Though no definitive detection of topology has yet been made, the approach laid out by Levin remains highly influential and relevant‚Äîespecially as future missions (like CMB-S4 or LiteBIRD) promise greater sensitivity and resolution.
