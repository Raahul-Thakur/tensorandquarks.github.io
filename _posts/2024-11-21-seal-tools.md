# Teaching AI to Use Tools — The Right Way  
**A Deep Dive into Seal-Tools: The Dataset That Makes LLMs Smarter Agents**

Imagine asking your AI assistant to “book a flight to Paris, then schedule a taxi to the airport and convert the final bill to Euros.” Sounds simple, right? In reality, for most AI models, this isn’t just 
hard — it’s nearly impossible to get right without human babysitting.

That’s because tool use, chaining functions, and executing multi-step operations **requires structured reasoning**, parameter handling, and format control — things even the smartest LLMs struggle with today.

<!--more-->

This is the exact problem that the new research paper [Seal-Tools: Self-Instruct Tool Learning Dataset for Agent Tuning and Detailed Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08355) seeks to solve. If you’re 
interested in building reliable AI agents, this paper is a must-read — and this post will walk you through why.

## Why Tool Use Is the Future of AI

Large Language Models like GPT-4 and Claude have sparked a revolution in natural language understanding. But the next frontier is not just understanding — it’s **action**.

> Tools are the hands of the AI. Without them, a model can speak, but it cannot do.

An AI that writes a travel plan is helpful. But one that calls an API to book the trip, checks the weather, converts currencies, and sends you a summary — now that’s a **true agent**.

This kind of reasoning requires a model to:

- **Choose the right tool for the job**
- **Fill in the correct parameters**
- **Follow strict output formats** (e.g., JSON or function calls)
- **Chain tools across multiple steps**

Unfortunately, even the most powerful models today fall short. That’s where **Seal-Tools** steps in.

## What Is Seal-Tools?

Seal-Tools is a **large-scale, structured dataset** built to train and evaluate LLMs in tool-use scenarios. The core idea is to **teach AI how to call tools just like developers use APIs** — only in natural 
language.

It includes:

- 1,042 unique tools across diverse domains  
- Over 100,000 tool-use instances generated using *Self-Instruct*  
- Examples of multi-tool, nested, and chained operations  
- Strict JSON-format outputs for consistency and automation  

Each tool is described just like a real-world API:

```json
{
  "name": "currency_converter",
  "description": "Convert a value between currencies.",
  "parameters": {
    "from_currency": "USD",
    "to_currency": "EUR",
    "amount": "100.0"
  },
  "required": ["from_currency", "to_currency", "amount"]
}
```

And each **task instance** simulates a realistic scenario:

> “Convert 100 USD to EUR, and then use the result to calculate VAT in France.”

## How It Was Built — The Self-Instruct Pipeline

What’s genius about Seal-Tools is that it uses LLMs **to generate the dataset themselves** — but with checks, balances, and curation.

Here’s the step-by-step pipeline:

- **Field Generation** – Domains like finance, health, or travel are first generated.  
- **Tool Design** – Each field includes several tool descriptions.  
- **Instance Generation** – Each tool gets basic and complex tool-usage tasks.  
- **Validation** – JSON output is validated for structure and semantic consistency.  

This lets researchers **generate massive datasets quickly** while maintaining realism and structure.

## Evaluation: Metrics That Actually Matter

Seal-Tools introduces three targeted evaluation metrics:

1. **Format Accuracy** – Can the model generate valid JSON or function calls?  
2. **Tool Selection Accuracy** – Did it choose the correct tools for the task?  
3. **Parameter Filling Accuracy** – Did it supply correct and complete values?

These are **objective and automatable**, unlike vague scores used in standard NLP evaluations.

## What Did the Experiments Reveal?

Models tested in the paper include:

- GPT-3.5 and GPT-4  
- Claude 2  
- LLaMA2-7B, Vicuna, Mistral-7B  
- A fine-tuned LLaMA2 trained on Seal-Tools  

**Key takeaways**:

- GPT-4 leads the pack, but still struggles with nested or chained tool usage.  
- Open-source models have significant limitations out-of-the-box.  
- Fine-tuning on Seal-Tools improves tool performance by **15–20%**.  

> Even top models are not great tool users… *yet*.

## How Seal-Tools Stands Out

| Feature                | ToolBench | API-Bank | ToolAlpaca | **Seal-Tools** |
|------------------------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Number of Tools        | ~300      | ~100     | ~50         | **1,042**       |
| Multi-Tool Support     | ❌         | ❌        | Partial     | ✅             |
| Nested Calls           | ❌         | ❌        | ❌           | ✅             |
| Format Consistency     | YAML      | Loose    | JSON-ish    | **Strict JSON** |
| Auto-Evaluation        | ❌         | ❌        | ❌           | ✅             |

**Seal-Tools** is *bigger, more complex, and better structured* than any other tool-using dataset available.

## Why This Matters for Agentic AI

We’re entering an era of **agentic computing**, where LLMs are expected to plan, decide, and act on our behalf.

For this to work, models must:

- Understand tool specifications  
- Format structured calls  
- Handle edge cases and data dependencies  
- Chain multiple tools together intelligently  

**Seal-Tools is the training ground for this future.** It’s more than a dataset — it’s a *curriculum* for teaching LLMs real-world behavior.

## Final Thoughts

**Seal-Tools** offers a major step forward in developing LLMs that go beyond chatting and start executing real tasks. It’s built on the idea that agents must not just *talk*, but *do* — and 
gives us the tools to train them accordingly.

Whether you’re building autonomous agents, developing smart assistants, or researching LLM capabilities, **Seal-Tools should be part of your stack**.
